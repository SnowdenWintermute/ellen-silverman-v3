        <h2>Lucretia Ellen McGuff-Silverman</h2>
        <p>
          Ellen has lived in Roosevelt, New Jersey since 1990. The rural nature
          of the town is reflected in her paintings of landscapes as well as her
          fascination with color and how light affects it. She uses that play of
          color and light to portray her reaction to her world.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The style of the acrylic paintings is impressionistic with bright
          colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          She has a MFA in Oil Painting, from American University. Her work has
          been exhibited in regional galleries, one person and juries shows.
