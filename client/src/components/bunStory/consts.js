    "The Flash of light fades from your vision while the smell of ozone lingers briefly. The portal must have worked. As you regain your footing you see a nightstand supporting the book they mentioned. You ceremoniously dust off your jacket and grin as your previous anxiety becomes a growing courage. Upon picking it up you notice the dusty tome in your hands has been disturbed recently. Judging by the shoddy handwriting inside you determine it’s been used in a hurry and by The Professor no less.",
  text2: `“I couldn’t have been that far behind you. Professor... where are you?”`,
  text3:
    "The message on the front page reads: By the time you get this I’m guessing you’ve already made the jump. I was a fool to have trusted the Cern-Art Division. My own ambition will be the downfall of more than you can imagine. With the power I created... I can only hope you never read this and that you were able to destroy the access portals before it is too late. Gulp. But, if you did follow me then you need to be ready. Rip out these pages and look for the star map hidden across the rooms. Once you collect them all, meet me at the final location to end this madness. I can only hope we’re in time. When I first arrived here it was clear that one of their away teams had already landed. Be swift and be vigilant! \n \n PS: Careful around the corners. You never know what room you’ll end up in. -Professor",
  text4:
    "Well this is turning into an interesting day. Ok... Where’s that star map.”",
  text5:
    "The Professor was right. The room had been accessed before and it was clear from the streams of light that penetrated the interior. The Cern-Art operatives were extracting the texture from this realm to be used in their nefarious experiments and most likely knew about the star map. I have to act fast if we want to save this realm.",
  text6:
    "Glistening light beams strewn across the walls and furniture were hypnotising in their beauty. They knew not of their own destruction and carried on more beautifully than ever. The walls and the ceiling were rotating prismatic gyroscopes seen from within a crystal sphere. Their rotational speed seemed to flutter between hues depending on the emotions of the individual inside the room.",
  text7:
    "After searching the wonderously lit room you find in the bottom of the teacups the first clue of the star map. There in the cups was a crystal eye with purple iris and deep pupils. When held up to your eye you can see a kaleidoscopic image of a star in space. You tuck it away in your jacket and turn the corner.",
  text8:
    "After a brief flash of color you take stock of your position and recognize the room as the Museum Courtyard.",
  text9:
    "Before continuing you turn your head to where you entered and see no sign of the Tea Room. You feel as sense of je ne sais pas. Almost like a force beyond your comprehension is guiding you through the rooms safely. Although slightly disturbed at the thought that something could be skulking in the shadows you press on through the courtyard.",
  text10:
    "“Perhaps these realms aren’t devoid of life as The Professor specula-”",
  text11:
    "Your voice is interrupted as a rustling in the plants near you startles the otherwise peaceful room. Steeling yourself, you remember the fate of this world rests on your shoulders, you slowly approach the moving leaves.",
  text12:
    "To your disbelief there is a glowing crystal torso flopping against the ferns. The crystal eye in your pocket raises in temperature as you get closer. After collecting yourself, your inspection reveals a globe of black opaline set in the abdomen. Inside the swirling crystals you can make out another star.",
  text13:
    "Seemingly non dangerous though a bit precarious you strap the abdomen to your back with your belt and continue through the iconic hallway. The plants bend toward you as you now step with the world on two sets of shoulders. Once again, you go around the corner.",
  text14:
    "Another flash, though softer this time, as you arrive in Harry’s Living room.",
  text15:
    "The weight of the writhing and twisting torso beckons you to sit on the couch for a moment. A feathery comfort surrounds you like the pleasant folds of a heavy blanket. The room seems to bend the light around you in all directions, breathing as you breath, sighing as you sigh. And as you sigh you hear the crack of glass from within your lungs.",
  text16:
    "You cough up small specks of red liquid. At first startled, your previously comfortable state turns to alarm. You grab your ribcage and breath slow. You can’t sense any pain or discomfort. In front you of you on the polished blue mahogany table you can see the surface glass has been split in two. You reach out and touch the crack. It begins to drip more of the red liquid onto the carpet. Drop by drop you feel light headed.",
  text17: "“Staying here too long could be lethal. I gotta get moving.”",
  text18:
    "After equipping the torso and checking on the crystal eye you scour the room for clues.",
  text19:
    "Then before you are just about to give up another loud crack echoes off your eardrum. Turning back to the table you see the champagne bottle has broken open. Inside the green shards of thick glass another eyeball looks up at you. It’s deep pupils hold another star guarded within the light purple iris. You carefully scoop it up and slip it into your pocket with the other one. Somewhat relieved you turn the corner in a hurry.",
  text20:
    "A dim light clouds your vision for a moment as you enter the Director’s Office.",
  text21:
    "The carpet’s floral patterns come alive with slow serpentine movements.",
  text22:
    "Your feet avoid the more spacious places in the carpet for fear there is no bottom to their rampant entanglement. Just as you step off the carpet to the bookcase nook you catch a glimpse of something shiny within the overgrowth deep in the flower’s grasps. Convinced you are seeing things you peruse the bookshelf for another message from The Professor.",
  text23:
    "Book by book you search for a clue. Nothing but novels and dictionaries.",
  text24:
    "You search the desk. Pens and pencils, stationary, and office manifests of cargo and shipping plans.",
  text25:
    "A moment of daydreaming washes over you as you plop down into the Director’s chair.",
  text26:
    "The durable leather supports you and your torsos in the wooden frame. As you gaze through the pillars of glass next to you into the infinite light you can see your daydreams dancing.",
  text27:
    "Starkly awoken from your stupor you grab at your leg as a slithering intruder worms it’s way up your calf. The floral pattern of the carpet has broken through its fabric into the room and has begun lashing out at the furniture relentlessly expanding and consuming. Quickly you jump upwards carelessly knocking the chair backwards through the glass panes letting in a torrent of wind made out of streams of silver light.",
  text28:
    "Flailing your hands wildly you remove the plant from your pants leg and hurdle over the roots and petals of the now gigantic flowers.",
  text29:
    "On the side of the room with the bookcase you are just about to leave when you see a flower blooming in the center of the room.",
  text30:
    "There in the red blossom you see four crystal limbs where the pestles would have been. Both astonished at the beauty of the living flowering plant and terrified you jump back into the fray to retrieve the crystal limbs. You quickly hoist them up and tuck them into your jacket as you use one of the legs to fend off overly inquisitive roots. By the time you clear the plants grasp it has churned the room’s fixture into debris as you turn the corner.",
  text31:
    "The dim light of transition mimics looking through a tablecloth at the sun. Pixel-esque pentagons of light dot your eyes as you blink a few times to reorient. After pulling some leaves out of your pockets and dusting off the pollen you connect the limbs to the torso. They feel right at home and the writhing torso settles down a bit. Before you sling the body back onto your back you notice the palms and knees of the limbs have similar dark crystals filled with stars.",
  text32: `“I think I’m getting the hang of this. Now... where could the head be?”`,
  text33: `Whilst doing all of your adjustments and deductions you hadn’t looked around much to recognize that you were in the Italian Restaurant. The aromas of Italian cuisine fill your lungs and your mouth begins to water.`,
  text34: `You spot the crystal head in the center of the room almost immediately housing long white roses inside a vase.`,
  text35: `“That was easy.”`,
  text36: `As you approach the head you hear the sound of a camera flash coming from the right side of the room!`,
  text37: `“Gahh, not good, not good! It must be the away team from Cern-Art.”`,
  text38: `You fall back to the furthest table and tuck the incomplete body under it and then stash yourself in the adjacent one. Four masked Cern-Art employees enter the room slightly discombobulated. You watch as they come to and begin to search the area.`,
  text39: `Cern-Art Employee A: “Hey haven’t we been to this room already?!”`,
  text40: `Cern-Art Employee B: “Keep searching we can’t let The Professor’s clues escape us. Your job depends on it.”`,
  text41: `Cern-Art Employee C: “Yeah but we’ve haven’t found a single one so far and plus this place gives me the creeps.”`,
  text42: `Cern-Art Employee D: “He’s right! We don’t even know what happened to the first squad! This place is dangerous.”`,
  text43: `Cern-Art Empolyee B: “I know. That’s why we are getting The Professor’s clues and getting the hell out of here.”`,
  text44: `Cern-Art Employee A, C, D: “Yes Captian!”`,
  text45: `Cern-Art Captain: “Spread out, leave nothing unsearched.”`,
  text46: `“Shit...”`,
  text47: `They begin searching up and around the walls, under tablecloths, inside the wine glasses, and even in the maître d’ lectern.`,
  text48: `Cern-Art Employee A: “I’m tellin’ you Captain we’ve been here.”`,
  text49: `Cern-Art Employee D: “Wait... I think I found something. Yeah come check it out. It’s the head. It was in the vase the whole time!”`,
  text50: `Cern-Art Captain: ”Excellent work private Dunckles. You’re in for a promotion. Let’s move. We have intel that there is only one per room.”`,
  text51: `Cern-Art Employee C: “Yeah, and we don’t want to stay too long past the room’s convergence point.”`,
  text52: `Cern-Art Private dunkles: “Whoaa, yeah! Promotion baby!”`,
  text53: `Cern-Art Employee C: “Don’t get your hopes up. I got a bad feeling about this.”`,
  text54: `Cern-Art Private Dunckles: “Aww you’re no fun Sarge.”`,
  text55: `Cern-Art Captain: “Clear coms you two. And Sargent Rack. I’d appreaciate a bit more positivity.”`,
  text56: `Cern-Art Sgt. Rack: “Affirmative. Please... plot us a course out of here Private Erith.”`,
  text57: `Cern-Art Private Erith: “Yes Sarge. Uploading nav map coordinates to your UI.”`,
  text58: `Cern-Art Captain: “Lead the way Dunckles.”`,
  text59: `Cern-Art Private Dunckles: “Roger!”`,
  text60: `The Cern-Art team turns the corner just out of your sight and you hear another camera flash.`,
  text61: `The head unfortunately eludes you. You collect the rest of the star map and prepare to pursue the team. You’ve got to get those clues, or the worst could happen.`,
  text62: `A particularly sharp looking fork finds its way into your hand. And as you lift it off the table so to do all the other table’s forks fall to the floor.`,
  text63: `“Stranger things have happened thus far I guess.”`,
  text64: `You shrug it off and turn the corner.`,
  text65: `Blue ribbons of light fall like snow in front of your eyelids. As you blink it away you find yourself at Lydia’s The room’s cool air raises a few hairs as you carefully approach the dining table.`,
  text66: `A clock ticks in the corner naggingly reminding you of the urgency of your mission. You hear chatter in the hall but it’s too late to hide. The Cern-Art team is upon you.`,
  text67: `You ready your sharp fork only to find that the crew is dressed for dinner and already a few drinks in.`,
  text68: `They ignore you as they take their seats and continue with their conversation. Startled and also a little annoyed they didn’t invite you to sit with them. You begin to notice that they have stowed their gear in the corner by the fireplace.`,
  text69: `Carefully with your fork still raised you walk over to see if the star map head is there.`,
  text70: `Once you get there though the warmth of the hearth beckons you closer like a siren song. You begin to put down the heavy torso and limbs. As you take off the star map and place it next to the Cern-Art gear in the pile you begin to feel hungry and thirst for drink. Though somewhat confused you feel warm and comfortable and take off your jacket as well. You toss it with the rest of their gear and feel an intense happiness at the thought of a great meal!`,
  text71: `You turn to the Cern-Art team and they smile at you, able to see you now they treat you as a friend. Dunckles pours you a glass of zinfandel as you take your seat. The comfy raised pillows feel good on your thighs as you sink into the chair’s architecture. You feel fully supported and pleased to be amongst your friends at such a cherished occasion. Captain bursts through the kitchen door holding a covered silver platter. You lick your lips in anticipation of the delectable main course.`,
  text72: `Placed down in the center the steamy heat of the dish floods the table with aromas so tender and delicious your mouth begins to water.`,
  text73: `You take a large gulp of the wine and get your fork ready to eat. Rack requests to do the honors in an exaggerated attempt to emulate a fancy servant as he lifts the dish cover sky high only barely missing the chandelier. But what greeted their famished ravenous faces was not a delicious roasted bird or filet of fish or robust pickled ham, no. It was a simmering crystal brain coated in a slippery broth.`,
  text74: `For at least fifteen seconds the table goers were frozen in confusion. A little bit of drool dripped down Erith’s mouth and plinked on her plate. This seemingly benign event triggered a rush of memories in each person stirring to the forefront of everyone’s mind why it was the reason for them being there. A chill was in the air and the warmth from before had all but vanished. Captain was the first to act.`,
  text75: `He lunged forward and grabbed the brain only to have it’s slippery exterior cause it to eject upward into the air knocking against the chandelier and dislocating some of the dangling shiny crystals in all directions`,
  text76: `You, still reeling at the events that had just taken place, recollect yourself and stand up. You make eye contact with Dunckles who looks just as confused as you as a large glass chandelier crystal bonks them on the head. You dash back to collect your things near the now desolated fireplace filled with a void of cold and showy stones. Behind you, you hear the disarray of crashing sounds and yelps from the Cern-Art crew.`,
  text77: `You turn around to see the table cloven in two and all the dishes piled and cracked in the middle as a growing vortex of wind begins to ramp up and pull you closer. A few feet in front of you the crystal brain star map lays serendipitously on the floor. The captain sees you looking at it from under the broken table.`,
  text78: `Cern-Art Captain: “Grab it Rack don’t let whoever that is get it!”`,
  text79: `Rack turns to you and runs forward but slips on the red rug and faceplants. The vortex is too strong near the table and keeps pulling Rack back. Using a close by chair you scoop the brain closer to you and tuck it under your coat. Unable to find the head you quickly run away from the room leaving the screams of the crew behind you as you turn the corner.`,
  text80: `Heart pounding, after you’ve turned the corner you find no expected flash of light to greet you.`,
  text81: `Now in the Unattached Porch you take a moment to breath. “The halflife of the convergence points must be shortening. What the hell is The Professor doing?!”`,
  text82: `The Professor: “I’m shutting it down.”`,
  text83: `Not knowing you weren’t alone you turn startled to see The Professor! They looked worse for wear – lab coat all torn up and sunken weary eyes.`,
  text84: `“Professor! The Cern-Art team was just behind me. I found most of your clues but couldn’t get a hold of the last piece, the head.”`,
  text85: `Professor: “Then you’ve done more than I could. The rooms they... They are unraveling. I’m not sure we have any time left. It’s... it’s over.”`,
  text86: `“No way! We have most of the map... we can just fill in the blanks! Come on you’re The Professor! You can figure this out, I
  know you can.”`,
  text87: `Professor: “Perhaps you’re right. By golly perhaps! But... but... hmmm. If we fail to plot the connection point correctly. We could end up losing more than just our way home. We could end up... anywhere.”`,
  text88: `The thought of ending up anywhere was a terrifying idea. Just then a cool breeze flowed through the beige curtains and a distant wind chime could be heard. The peaceful nature of the porch calmed The Professor as they paced and eventually the sunken eyes of the tattered professor gleamed with hope and adventure. They remembered when they started this project, so young, so naïve. But now they were fiercer than ever and ready to take risks even if it meant low chance of success.`,
  text89: `Professor: “Ok let’s assemble the map in my study. Come I know the path from here. After all, I helped design the place.”`,
  text90: `You both smile and you follow The Professor seamlessly around the corner.`,
  text91: `In the spacious study you can see artifacts of adventures long past and reams of maps and scrolls and comfortable chairs for thinking and relaxing. A room made for a mind to imagine and think and learn and grow. In the center of the red carpet you help The Professor assemble the map and prepare to plot a way out. Hopefully back home.`,
  text92: `Professor: “This map is the key. It is my legacy. This map, even incomplete, shares with me so many memories and dreams. With the right application we can find our way back. There’s only one problem.”`,
  text93: `The Professor stood up with a solemn stone face as they turned to their desk and retrieved a colorful letter opener. It had a decorative wooden parrot relief on the hilt end of the blade. They came back to the body on the floor and placed the letter opener down. Before you could say no The Professor grabbed the letter opener plunged it into their heart.`,
  text94: `“Professor!!!”`,
  text95: `The agonizing pain of The Professor seemed to warp the room into a purple and red beating tissue. The walls became a hybrid of flesh and paint as it was transformed into the inside of a beating heart. Crashing through the main window a large wooden blade knocked over a vase and sent the flowers soaring through the air. They landed on an artery covered in chairs and rugs and maps. The floor and bookshelves began to twist and crack and The Professor’s body fell to the floor. The floor opened up and The Professor was fused to the ground. The pigment of their face drained away and the star map began to jitter.`,
  text96: `A small crystalline structure began to form itself around the map’s brain. The head was forming right before your eyes. Just as soon as you realized the head was fully complete and the eyes in place and the brain protected the star map blinked once and stood up. The Professor’s body turned a dark gray and their clothes were assimilated with the flesh that bound them. The star map was on its feet and it turned to you.`,
  text97: `You look, mouth gaping, at the star map’s crystal body in motion. It’s effortless movements were elegant and deliberate and resemble The Professor.`,
  text98: `The walls became gray and were rapidly decaying as they began to fold and crumble. The stench of iron and death filled the air.`,
  text99: `Star Map: “I am the star map. The Professor’s creation. They want you to escape this place. Come with me. I can take you home.”`,
  text100: `Grieving and shocked. You try to comprehend The Professors wish to sacrifice themselves to save you. You reach out your hand to the star map and touch its crystal fingers. The opaline palms of the map are cool to the touch.`,
  text101: `You feel a connection with all the rooms in the realm. You feel even more rooms and even more realms of rooms. Some rooms never to be seen, some half made, and some just out of reach. There were rooms that could have been, and realms that would never be.`,
  text102: `Then all of a sudden you see a room you recognize.`,
  text103: `You see your room.`,
  text104: `You turn the corner.`,
