The floral pattern of the carpet has broken through its fabric into the room and has begun lashing out at the furniture relentlessly expanding and consuming. Quickly you jump upwards carelessly knocking the chair backwards through the glass panes letting in a torrent of wind made out of streams of silver light.",text28:"Flailing your hands wildly you remove the plant from your pants leg and hurdle over the roots and petals of the now gigantic flowers.",text29:"On the side of the room with the bookcase you are just about to leave when you see a flower blooming in the center of the room.",text30:"There in the red blossom you see four crystal limbs where the pestles would have been. Both astonished at the beauty of the living flowering plant and terrified you jump back into the fray to retrieve the crystal limbs. You quickly hoist them up and tuck them into your jacket as you use one of the legs to fend off overly inquisitive roots. By the time you clear the plants grasp it has churned the room\u2019s fixture into debris as you turn the corner.",text31:"The dim light of transition mimics looking through a tablecloth at the sun. Pixel-esque pentagons of light dot your eyes as you blink a few times to reorient. After pulling some leaves out of your pockets and dusting off the pollen you connect the limbs to the torso. They feel right at home and the writhing torso settles down a bit. Before you sling the body back onto your back you notice the palms and knees of the limbs have similar dark crystals filled with stars.",text32:"\u201cI think I\u2019m getting the hang of this. Now... where could the head be?\u201d",text33:"Whilst doing all of your adjustments and deductions you hadn\u2019t looked around much to recognize that you were in the Italian Restaurant.

It must be the away team from Cern-Art.\u201d",text38:"You fall back to the furthest table and tuck the incomplete body under it and then stash yourself in the adjacent one.

You begin to put down the heavy torso and limbs. As you take off the star map and place it next to the Cern-Art gear in the pile you begin to feel hungry and thirst for drink. Though somewhat confused you feel warm and comfortable and take off your jacket as well.

Rack requests to do the honors in an exaggerated attempt to emulate a fancy servant as he lifts the dish cover sky high only barely missing the chandelier. But what greeted their famished ravenous faces was not a delicious roasted bird or filet of fish or robust pickled ham, no. It was a simmering crystal brain coated in a slippery broth.",text74:"For at least fifteen seconds the table goers were frozen in confusion. A little bit of drool dripped down Erith\u2019s mouth and plinked on her plate. This seemingly benign event triggered a rush of memories in each person stirring to the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind why it was the reason for them being there. A chill was in the air and the warmth from before had all but vanished. Captain was the first to act.",text75:"He lunged forward and grabbed the brain only to have it\u2019s slippery exterior cause it to eject upward into the air knocking against the chandelier and dislocating some of the dangling shiny crystals in all directions",text76:"You, still reeling at the events that had just taken place, recollect yourself and stand up. You make eye contact with Dunckles who looks just as confused as you as a large glass chandelier crystal bonks them on the head.

We could end up losing more than just our way home. We could end up... anywhere.\u201d",text88:"The thought of ending up anywhere was a terrifying idea. Just then a cool breeze flowed through the beige curtains and a distant wind chime could be heard. The peaceful nature of the porch calmed The Professor as they paced and eventually the sunken eyes of the tattered professor gleamed with hope and adventure. They remembered when they started this project, so young, so na\xefve. But now they were fiercer than ever and ready to take risks even if it meant low chance of success.",text89:"Professor: \u201cOk let\u2019s assemble the map in my study.

After all, I helped design the place.\u201d",text90:"You both smile and you follow The Professor seamlessly around the corner.",text91:"In the spacious study you can see artifacts of adventures long past and reams of maps and scrolls and comfortable chairs for thinking and relaxing. A room made for a mind to imagine and think and learn and grow. In the center of the red carpet you help The Professor assemble the map and prepare to plot a way out. Hopefully back home.",text92:"Professor: \u201cThis map is the key. It is my legacy. This map, even incomplete, shares with me so many memories and dreams.

It had a decorative wooden parrot relief on the hilt end of the blade. They came back to the body on the floor and placed the letter opener down. Before you could say no The Professor grabbed the letter opener plunged it into their heart.",text94:"\u201cProfessor!!!\u201d",text95:"The agonizing pain of The Professor seemed to warp the room into a purple and red beating tissue. The walls became a hybrid of flesh and paint as it was transformed into the inside of a beating heart. Crashing through the main window a large wooden blade knocked over a vase and sent the flowers soaring through the air. They landed on an artery covered in chairs and rugs and maps. The floor and bookshelves began to twist and crack and The Professor\u2019s body fell to the floor. The floor opened up and The Professor was fused to the ground. The pigment of their face drained away and the star map began to jitter.",text96:"A small crystalline structure began to form itself around the map\u2019s brain. The head was forming right before your eyes. Just as soon as you realized the head was fully complete, the eyes in place and the brain protected, the star map blinked once and stood up. The Professor\u2019s body turned a dark gray and their clothes were assimilated with the flesh that bound them. The star map was on its feet and it turned to you.",text97:"You look, mouth gaping, at the star map\u2019s crystal body in motion. It\u2019s effortless movements were elegant and deliberate and resemble The Professor.",text98:"The walls became gray and were rapidly decaying as they began to fold and crumble. The stench of iron and death filled the air.",text99:"Star Map: \u201cI am the star map. The Professor\u2019s creation. They want you to escape this place. Come with me.
